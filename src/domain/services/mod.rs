// Domain services contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit in entities
// They orchestrate between entities and use ports to interact with infrastructure

// Services will be added as needed
// Examples:
// pub mod encryption_service;
// pub mod capture_orchestrator;
// pub mod security_service;
